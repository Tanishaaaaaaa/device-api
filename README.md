Assignment 1 :


This project is a *Node.js REST API* integrated with a *MongoDB database*. It provides four core endpoints to manage *devices*:

- *GET*: Retrieve device details
- *POST*: Create a new device
- *PUT*: Update device information
- *DELETE*: Remove a device

The API is hosted as a *web application*, and the endpoints can be accessed from any machine, enabling easy interaction with the API. The application has been manually deployed to ensure it is accessible for external use.
